# 🚀 C# Learning Journey

Welcome to my **C# Learning Journey Repository** — a structured collection of projects, challenges, and applications built as I explore the world of C# programming.  
Each folder represents a new step in my growth as a developer — from learning syntax to building real-world console apps.

## 🧱 **1. Basics/**
> 📘 Simple starter programs — where it all began.

- `HelloWorld/` → Classic first program  
- `HelloWorldApp/` → Slightly extended “Hello World” example using variables and console formatting  

---

## 💡 **2. Challenges/**
> 🧠 Coding puzzles that sharpen logic and C# fundamentals.

- `ChallengeProject-foreach-if-array-CSharp/` → Arrays and loop logic  
- `FraudulentOrderChallenge/` → Conditional structures  
- `SubscriptionRenewalRate/` → Calculations and flow control  
- *(and many more…)*  

---

## 🧩 **3. GuidedProjects/**
> 🧭 Structured, step-by-step projects that apply multiple C# concepts.

- `Guided-project-Debug-and-handle-exceptions/`  
- `GuidedProject-PlanaPettingZooVisit/`  
- `Guided-Project-Branching-Looping/`  
- `Guided-project-Work-with-variable-data-in-CSharp-main/`  

These projects show how I combined control flow, error handling, and debugging into complete mini systems.

---

## 🎮 **4. Games/**
> 🎲 Fun console games built purely in C#.

- `RockPaperScissorsGame/`  
- `WordGuessingGame/`  
- `NumberGuessingGame/`  
- `DiceMini-GameChallenge/`  

Each game reinforces loops, randomization, and user interaction.

---

## 💻 **5. ConsoleApps/**
> 🧰 Real-world console-based projects with full functionality.

- `Console-App-ATM-Simulation/`  
- `Console-App-Bank-Account-Simulator/`  
- `Console-App-Contact-Book/`  
- `Console-App-Library-Book-Manager/`  
- `Console-App-Employee-Payroll-System/`  
- `Console-App-Inventory-Management-System/`  
- *(and more practical console apps...)*  

---

## 🧠 **6. Applications/**
> 🧮 Larger, structured programs demonstrating real-world logic and organization.

- `StudentGradingApplication/`  
- `TestProject/`  
- *(More projects coming soon!)*  

---

## 🪄 **7. MiniProjects/**
> 💡 Small experimental or creative console projects.

- `RolePlayingGameBattleChallenge/`  
- `Pyramid-Drawing-App/`  
- `VariableScopeChallenge/`  

---

## ⚙️ **8. Tools/**
> 🧰 Utility tools and text/data manipulation helpers.

- `EncryptionDecryptionTool/`  
- `Search-App/`  
- `WorkWithVariableData/`  

---

## 🪟 **9. WinForms/**
> 🖥️ GUI-based applications for Windows — built using WinForms.

- `ContactBookWinForms/` *(coming soon!)*  

---

## 📘 **Technologies Used**
- 🧱 **Language:** C# (.NET)  
- 🧰 **IDE:** Visual Studio / VS Code  
- 🧩 **Concepts Covered:**  
  - Data types & variables  
  - Loops, conditions & arrays  
  - Exception handling  
  - Debugging & reusable methods  
  - File I/O & data manipulation  
  - Object-oriented programming  
  - Console interaction

## 🧑‍💻 **About This Repository**
This repository represents my hands-on learning experience with **C# programming** — inspired by tutorials, freeCodeCamp, Microsoft Learn, and self-guided projects.  

Each project folder includes:
- `Program.cs` → Source code  
- `README.md` → Explanation, concepts, and output examples *(added progressively)*  

---

## 🌟 **Future Plans**
- Add README files to each individual project  
- Expand with GUI and ASP.NET projects  
- Include tests and documentation for major apps  

---

## 🤝 **Connect With Me**
